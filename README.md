# Guardian
Gopher Industries - Guardian App 
Guardian is an activity monitoring and profiling system for the aged care sector with plans to expand to residential homes. Guardian uses non-invasive radar technology to record a user’s activity and classify these activities over time. Guardian utilises the classified data to predict possible physical and mental health conditions associated with that behaviour.  
The goal of the project is to alert the patient’s carer and/or health professional to unusual changes in monitored behaviour. Additionally, Guardian detects more urgent incidents such as fall detection.  

The key features of Guardian are:

•	Patent profile capture, edit and search.

•	Monitoring and profiling patient activities. 

•	Alerting caregivers and supervisors during an emergency. 

•	Predicting potential physical and mental health conditions at an early stage. 

•	Providing suggestions to see a health professional based on health issues detected. 

•	Encouraging positive activities.

•	Generating weekly and monthly activity dashboards. 

•	Providing access to accurate real-time visualisation and patient position(s).

•	Ability to define a baseline for a patient. 

•	User management allows for defining Patient, Carer, and Admin users. 

# Installation 

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository.

Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project's root folder.

Once the project is successfully imported, connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable or set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using the AVD Manager in Android Studio.

Make sure that your Android device is set to developer mode and USB debugging is enabled. If you're using an AVD, it should already be set up for development.

In Android Studio, click on the "Run" button (green triangle) in the toolbar or select "Run" from the "Run" menu.

Choose the target device (your connected Android device or the AVD) and click "OK" to install and run the app.

Wait for the app to build, install, and launch on your Android device or AVD.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Android app.

# Running the App
If you have already completed the installation steps, ensure that your Android device is still connected to your computer via USB or your AVD is running.

In Android Studio, click on the "Run" button (green triangle) in the toolbar or select "Run" from the "Run" menu.

Choose the target device (your connected Android device or the AVD) and click "OK" to run the app.

Wait for the app to build, install any necessary updates, and launch on your Android device or AVD.

That's it! The Android app should now be running on your device or AVD.

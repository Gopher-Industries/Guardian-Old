# Guardian
Gopher Industries - Guardian App 
Guardian is an activity monitoring and profiling system for the aged care sector with plans to expand to residential homes. Guardian uses non-invasive radar technology to record a user’s activity and classify these activities over time. Guardian utilises the classified data to predict possible physical and mental health conditions associated with that behaviour.  
The goal of the project is to alert the patient’s carer and/or health professional to unusual changes in monitored behaviour. Additionally, Guardian detects more urgent incidents such as fall detection.  
The key features of Guardian are: 
•	Patent profile capture, edit and search. 
•	Monitoring and profiling patient activities. 
•	Alerting caregivers and supervisors during an emergency. 
•	Predicting potential physical and mental health conditions at an early stage. 
•	Providing suggestions to see a health professional based on health issues detected. 
•	Encouraging positive activities. 
•	Generating weekly and monthly activity dashboards. 
•	Providing access to accurate real-time visualisation and patient position(s). 
•	Ability to define a baseline for a patient. 
•	User management allows for defining Patient, Carer, and Admin users.
